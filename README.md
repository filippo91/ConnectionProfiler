# Connection Profiler

## What is this?
Connection Profiler is a Web Application developed as part of an accademic course teaching about cool technologies and frameworks like Spring, AngularJS, REST, WebSocket, etc...  

In particular, it aims to profile users' Internet connection quality, making customizable plots out of the information collected. 

## How it works?
This project consists of two major components: 
 - a web application, that shows statistical information you need to understand what is going on with your Internet connection;
 - a desktop application, i.e. a Proxy the user have to install on his devices to intercept all the http traffic and send the relevant measures to a RESTfull collection service.
